			<p>
				My name is D'Wana Stewart, I'm a native of San Francisco and majoring in Film and Broadcast Communications and possibly minor in Journalism, and attending Bay Area Video Coalition which is a internship which provides young adults with job opportunities and classes which will prepare them in their careers. The BAVC program I attend in FIlm?Code?Remix, which teaches me how to manipulate video as well as how to program and design web pages. I'm trasnferring to State in August 2013 from City College of San Francisco and need some assistance in finical aid. I attended City College for the last four years and prior to that I was attending UC Davis for a year after I graduated from June Jordan Small School for Equity in 2008. I have also recently started teaching Digital media classes and trying to earn my degree in Spring 2014.

			Video Remix of an interview by Zoe Salnave with 7 high school students about their cultures and their views on race and identity. With the use of of Mozilla Popcorn MArker, I was able to add text and extra information about the various culutural backgrounds each of the students share. Adding more content to this video better conveys the the signicance of Zoe Salnave's message in her interviews, stating "in many ways these students are different, and in many ways they are the same. "

			Still playing catch up with the iPhone? Most of the world is, but they don't even realize it. My video the "The Great and Powerful 'i'", gives a satirical look at the progression of the iPhone, from where its been to where its headed, and why Apple consumers can't seem to get enough
